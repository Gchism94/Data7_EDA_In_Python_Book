    "text": "(Team 2022)\nExploratory data analysis is an essential first step towards determining the validity of your data and should be performed throughout the data pipeline. However, EDA is often performed too late or not at all. The [Python programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language), is a widely used open source platform for data analysis and data visualization. This is because of the variety of libraries available and attentive community devoted to data analysis.\nHere, we utilize the pandas and pandas-profiling libraries to conduct preliminary exploratory data analysis aimed at diagnosing any major issues with an imported data set. pandas and pandas-profiling offers a clean and straightforward methodology to uncover issues such as data outliers, missing data, as well as summary statistical reports."

Enter, summary statistics.\nSummary statistics allow you to summarize large amounts of information about your data as quickly as possible.\n\nCentral Tendency\nMeasuring a central property of your data. Some examples you’ve probably heard of are:\n\nMean: Average value\nMedian: Middle value\nMode: Most common value\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that all values of central tendency can be pretty similar in this figure.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, in this figure, all measures are different. This will be important when we discuss statistical dispersion in chapter 3.\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistical Dispersion\nMeasure of data variability, scatter, or spread. Some examples you may have heard of:\n\nStandard deviation (SD): The amount of variation that occurs in a set of values.\nInterquartile range (IQR): The difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles\nOutliers: A value outside of \\(1.5 * IQR\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution Shape\nMeasures of describing the shape of a distribution, usually compared to a normal distribution (bell-curve)\n\nSkewness: The symmetry of the distribution\nKurtosis: The tailedness of the distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistical Dependence (Correlation)\nMeasure of causality between two random variables (statistically). Notably, we approximate causality with correlations (see correlation \\(\\neq\\) causation)\n\nNumerical values, but you can compare numericals across categories (see the first plot above).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeam, The Pandas Development. 2022.
